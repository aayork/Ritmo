> > Our app will provide an exciting and entertaining game environment for the user. Ritmo will offer a streamlined experience that will provide the user with a way to play and observe conducting and instrument skills. While a user will not be directly learning how to conduct or play an instrument, there will be the element of learning how to play along with rhythms and beats. We will ensure a safe environment for the user, allowing them to utilize the VisionPro toggle between Mixed Reality and complete Virtual Reality, and limited movement within the elements of the game.
